Create a Lottery Game in the form of React Components.
In the UI, show a button that generates a Lottery Ticket. The lottery ticket should consist of 3 digits that are randomly generated by the game.

Eg: 
The ticket could be 123 or 560 or 007 or any such 3 digit number.
After generating the ticket, the game simultaneously checks if the sum of the digits is equal to 15.
If the sum of the ticket's digits is equal to 15, then the user wins the Lottery. You can display a success message accordingly.
There is no fixed path to solve this question. You can use your learnings of components, props, states & events to solve this.
